# Rubik's Cube Solver using CFOP Method

![Rubik's Cube Banner](rubiks_cube_banner.png)

## Description

This is a Java program that solves the Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, also known as the Fridrich Method. CFOP is a popular speedcubing method that breaks down the solving process into four main steps: Cross, F2L (First Two Layers), OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer), and PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer). The program aims to provide an efficient and systematic way to solve the Rubik's Cube using these CFOP techniques.


## CFOP Method Steps

1. **Cross (Fridrich F2L)**: Complete the cross on one face of the cube, matching the adjacent edge colors with the center colors.
2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers simultaneously, pairing up corner and edge pieces in their correct positions.
3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient the last layer so that all the top face colors are aligned correctly.
4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the last layer pieces to solve the entire Rubik's Cube.


## Dependencies

The program does not require any external dependencies. It is written in pure Java.
